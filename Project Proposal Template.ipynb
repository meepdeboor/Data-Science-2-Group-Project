    "Safe and clean drinking water is vital to human health and survival. Governmental infrastructures in any country should be aware of the potability of the local water supply in order to provide their citizens with access to clean water. There are various qualities of water that determine its potability and classify it as being safe for drinking or not, including pH, hardness, and chloramine concentration. An understanding of how these different chemical properties affect the probability of the water being potable would allow relevent governmental organizations to give better estimates of the quality of water from a specific environment. Thus, the purpose of our project is to determine the probability of water being safe for drinking, based on the chemical identity of the water.\n",
    "\n",
    "As this model is concerned with the probability of water being potable or not, ie. a binary variable, it is a classification problem. This problem is both an inference problem and a prediction problem. We would like our model to be an accurate test for the potability of water based on measured chemical characteristics, hence the prediction aspect of the problem. However, it is also important to understand what characteristics of the water are most relevant in determining its potability so that those characteristics can be highlighted for more in-depth analysis. A more general understanding of the trend would also be relevant for quick back-handed estimates of water potability for time-sensitive situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assess our model by the false positive rate and accuracy. We want to minimize this as if our model as false positive are more impactful than false negatives. This is because we would rather someone not drink potable water than someone drink non-potable water. We also want to prioritize accuracy as we want to ensure that our model correctly categorizes the potability of water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to determine the impact, if any, of specific water characteristics, stepwise classification would be useful in building our model as since we have multiple potential dependent variables, stepwise classification would help narrow down what variables actually affect the water potability. We also may need to use ridge classification, as some of our variables may be correlated with each other, such as hardness and conductivity. This could be solved by using ridge classification."
